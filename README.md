Your Second Assignment
==========

Deadline: Monday, March 9th, 4:30pm

Do you remember the essay question on the exam about the adding the three integers? This is it! Well, it will be anyway, when you're done with it.

Your instructions are simple: Make this app work! You'll see that there is a skeleton application in this repository. It consists of two layouts and two activities. It is your assignment to do whatever you need to do make this application work properly.

In the event that you've forgotten, this program accepts three integers on one Activity, and displays the sum of the three values in the next Activity. As long as this functionality exists obviously within your application, you're welcome to also do whatever else you'd like to it.

You are to fork this project into your respective accounts, then clone, then develop, then pull request. Make sure you test your code carefully before you pull request as you will only be graded once. You may submit as many times as you'd like, but it must be done before class Monday, March 9th. I will only consider your most recent submission for grading. Therefore, if you submit a second pull request, do me a solid and close your first one.

If any instructions are unclear, please feel free to email me.
